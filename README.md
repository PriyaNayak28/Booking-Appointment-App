# Simple CRUD Application with Axios and Local Storage

## Description

This project is a simple web application that uses **Axios** to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. The data is fetched using an API and stored locally in the browser's **Local Storage** to ensure persistence. This project is great for practicing API requests with Axios and managing data locally with Local Storage.

## Features

- **Add Data**: Use a form to add new data to the list.
- **Edit Data**: Modify existing data entries.
- **Delete Data**: Remove data from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is saved in **Local Storage** to ensure it remains available across browser sessions.
- **Axios Integration**: API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are performed using Axios.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Axios** for API requests
- **Local Storage API**
